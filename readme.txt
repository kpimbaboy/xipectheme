A starter theme called Xipec.

== Description ==

Hi. I'm a starter theme called Xipec, if you like. I'm just a starting theme so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for :).

This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

Xipec is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2015 Automattic, Inc.
Underscores is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later.

Normalizing styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
